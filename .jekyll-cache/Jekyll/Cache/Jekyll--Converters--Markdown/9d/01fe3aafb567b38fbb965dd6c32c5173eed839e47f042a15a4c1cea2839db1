I"7<p>This ride to Lambertville is an extended version of <a href="/cycling/routes/lambertville.html">this ride</a>, and goes via the Sourlands on the way out, and then comes back via Pennington. SNIPPETEND The Sourlands section is beautiful, and can easily be extended to add more climbs by going down the north side of the ridge and then back up again. The way into Lambertville on Alexauken Creek Road is very pretty. The way back from Lambertville features two major climbs; Goat Hill and Pleasant Valley. After these, the ride is fairly flat back to Princeton.</p>

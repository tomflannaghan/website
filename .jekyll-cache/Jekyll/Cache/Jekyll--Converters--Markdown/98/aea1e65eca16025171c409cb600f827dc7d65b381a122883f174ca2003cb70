I"$<p>I have recently added a <a href="/cycling">new section</a> to my website showing my favourite cycling routes. I used <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/viking/">Viking</a> to produce the GPX files (a truly excellent application!) and then wanted to navigate them using my phone. There isn’t a way of importing premade GPX routes into google maps, so we need to use another application, and one that has all the features we need (and many more we don’t need) is <a href="http://osmand.net/">OsmAnd</a>, which is a great offline map viewer powered by OpenStreetMap. Unfortunately it has a really bad user interface (to my mind its only flaw really) so actually setting up and using OsmAnd for GPX track navigation is difficult. The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/osmand/wiki/HowToViewGPXTracks">official how-to guide</a> is here, and is fairly brief (there are <a href="https://code.google.com/p/osmand/wiki/HowToArticles">other how-tos</a> cover the installation). I summarise the process as follows for inclusion on each ride description:</p>

I"+<p>Synctex is a feature available in the more recent LaTeX distributions
that embeds links to locations in the source code (e.g. file name and
line number) at the corresponding locations in a pdf file. When viewed
with a compatible viewer and editor, we can automatically scroll the
viewer to the point in the pdf corresponding to the location of the
cursor in the editor, and vice versa.  Very handy if you are editing a
long document (e.g. a thesis or paper)! In theory, emacs and Okular is
an example of a compatible editor and viewer combination.</p>

I"õ<p>I have recently added a <a href="/cycling">new section</a> to my website showing my favourite cycling routes. I used <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/viking/">Viking</a> to produce the GPX files (a truly excellent application!) and then wanted to navigate them using my phone. There isnâ€™t a way of importing premade GPX routes into google maps, so we need to use another application, and one that has all the features we need (and many more we donâ€™t need) is <a href="http://osmand.net/">OsmAnd</a>, which is a great offline map viewer powered by OpenStreetMap. Unfortunately it has a really bad user interface (to my mind its only flaw really) so actually setting up and using OsmAnd for GPX track navigation is difficult. The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/osmand/wiki/HowToViewGPXTracks">official how-to guide</a> is here, and is fairly brief (there are <a href="https://code.google.com/p/osmand/wiki/HowToArticles">other how-tos</a> cover the installation). I summarise the process as follows for inclusion on each ride description:</p>

<p>The process of navigating a route on Android is a bit complicated so Iâ€™ll give detailed instructions. First, we need to install and set up the GPS mapping software. This part only needs to be done once.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand">OsmAnd</a>. Itâ€™s a great app with all the features we need.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch OsmAnd, and go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings-&gt;Navigation-&gt;Voice Guidance</code> and select your language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings-&gt;Data Management</code> download the maps for the area you are interested in (e.g. your country or state).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Next, we need to get the route into the phone. This is best done when the phone is connected to a PC rather than directly on the phone.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="">Download the GPX file</a> for this route.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Copy the GPX file to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">osmand/tracks</code> on the phoneâ€™s sd card. You may need to make the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tracks</code> directory yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch OsmAnd and go to the map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the menu button (three lines on top of each other).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Configure Map</code> and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GPX track...</code>. Select the track from the list. It should now display on the map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, click the menu button again, and click <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Directions</code>. Answer yes to the dialog that pops up, and then to actually start the navigation, press the blue triangle symbol in the bottom right corner.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All done. Enjoy your ride :-)</p>

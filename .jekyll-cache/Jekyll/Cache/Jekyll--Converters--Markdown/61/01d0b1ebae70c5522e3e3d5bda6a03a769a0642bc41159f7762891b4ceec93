I"E<p>I have written up and released some of the things I have
coded. I’ll add more to this page when I have time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/proxy-switcher.html">Proxy Switcher</a> — a Gnome shell extension for switching proxy settings very conviniently.</li>
  <li><a href="/pyrrtm.html">pyrrtm</a> — a python module for interfacing with the RRTM radiation code.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also contributed to some open source projects including <a href="http://www.scipy.org">scipy</a> (I did some work on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scipy.stats</code> module) and <a href="http://www.matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>, where I wrote the script that eventually turned into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matplotlib.streamplot</code> module (as illustrated in the banner to the site!).</p>

I"<p>A long while ago, I wrote a script for
<a href="http://www.matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a> that later (after lots of work by
<a href="http://www.tonysyu.com/">Tony Yu</a> and others) became the matplotlib
<a href="http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html?highlight=streamplot#matplotlib.pyplot.streamplot"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">streamplot</code></a>
function. This function generates plots that are constructed out of
streamlines of a flow, in such a way as to fill the domain uniformly
with such streamlines. I wrote the script to plot winds in the
tropical upper troposphere/lower stratosphere where there is a lot of
divergence and convergence (principally caused by convection over the
western Pacific and subsidence over the eastern Pacific.)</p>

I"ó<p>This is an <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/771/proxy-switcher/">extension to Gnome Shell</a> (<a href="https://github.com/tomflannaghan/proxy-switcher">git repo here</a>) that makes switching between Gnomeâ€™s proxy profiles simpler. Gnomeâ€™s proxy profiles (â€œAutomaticâ€, â€œManualâ€ and â€œNoneâ€) determine the system-wide proxy settings used by (among other things) Google Chrome.</p>

<p>The extension is <em>translated into lots of different languages</em>. I was able to do this because the phrases used in the extension also appear in the Network Settings program <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-control-center/"><code>gnome-control-center</code></a>, and have therefore been translated already by others.</p>

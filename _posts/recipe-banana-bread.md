I used a Bonne Mamman jam jar as the "cup" for dry ingredients! I think this a bit over an actual cup but not sure. This worked fine in 1 loaf tin - even though it was pretty full it didn't overflow while baking.

### Ingredients

- 3 big bananas (maybe 4 smaller ones)
- 0.8 stick butter (roughly 1 cup according to packet) melted
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg
- 1 cup sugar (turned out very sweet - maybe reduce a bit?)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1.5 cup flour

### Method

1. Pre-heat oven to 180C (350F) and line and grease a loaf tin.
2. Mash the bananas.
3. Mix all the ingredients in the order given above.
4. Pour into tin and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour (test to see if it's cooked with a knife).

title: Switching to Jekyll

Since I made this site, I had been using a custom static generator that I wrote. I enjoyed the experience of making my own system from scratch (as always very rewarding!) but have now decided to go with a more standard system: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The old system was too much work to maintain. Porting has been relatively easy as all the old content was already in Markdown.

These quantites work for a 18cm or smaller cake tin. Multiply by 1.5 to use a 20cm square tin.

### Ingredients

- 125g butter
- 175g caster sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 175g self raising flour
- 2 lemons
- 50g granulated sugar

### Method

1. Cream butter and caster sugar.
2. Add beaten eggs slowly, with a bit of flour each time. Beat well.
3. Add the rest of the flour gently, and the zest and juice of 1 lemon.
4. Pour into the greased and lined tin.
4. Bake at 180C for 25-30 minutes.
5. While it bakes, make a syrup using the other lemon's juice and 25g sugar.
5. Use a cocktail stick to make lots of holes in the cake when it comes out of the oven. Pour the syrup over the cake.
6. Combine the other 25g sugar with the zest of the lemon. Place on top.
6. Allow to cool fully before removing from the tin.

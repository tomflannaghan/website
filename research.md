### Equatorial waves

Equatorial waves are a family of planetary-scale waves which are confined to the equator by the correolis force, which acts as a waveguide. Kelvin waves are the the most active equatorial wave mode. They are only able to propagate eastwards and upwards, and provide significant forcing to the QBO in the stratosphere. Much of my work has focused on Kelvin waves near the tropopause; in this region these waves have a comparatively large amplitude, and are the major component of short timescale variability in the region. This means that they are critical for cirrus formation, diabatic mixing and stratospheric dehydration.

### Vertial Mixing

Vertical mixing (or clear air turbulence) occurs when the atmosphere becomes unstable to vertical shear. Near the tropopause we see quite a bit of vertical mixing, and it can be important for ozone and tropopause layer dynamics. I am interested in understanding how vertical mixing and equatorial waves fit together; there is some evidence that Kelvin waves can trigger vertical mixing in the tropical tropopause layer.

### QBO

The QBO is a wave-driven phenomenon in the tropical stratosphere, to which Kelvin waves and other equatorial waves are crucial. I'm currently looking into aspects of the QBO using dynamical cores. The QBO is quite challenging to model in simple models and behaves in a rather unintuitive way when details of the model are changed, making this an interesting problem to study.

I've cycled Cambridge to Oxford several times and this is my favourite route. It's scenic and quiet for the most part without being overly long. <!--more--> The Oxford end is definitely nicer than the Cambridge end, but the roads around Cambridge are generally fairly busy and boring. The ride also goes right past Woburn Safari Park, which is pretty cool. Lots of deer.

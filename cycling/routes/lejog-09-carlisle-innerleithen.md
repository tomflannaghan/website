A really pretty day. The route from Carlisle up to the Scottish border is easy, albeit fairly boring. In Gretna, it's a good idea to stock up on lunch as there aren't any shops further along the route from here. The rest of the ride from Gretna through Eskdalemuir Forest is really beautiful and remote.

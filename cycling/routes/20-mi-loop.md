This is a lovely 20 mile route from Princeton. <!--more--> The ride begins with Cherry Hill, and the wooded area along the Princeton ridge. Crusher Road is one of the nicest sections of this ride. Mine Road is the most significant climb (at around half way), and is punishingly steep. The ride back to Princeton is much flatter than the first half of the ride, and is mostly open farmland.

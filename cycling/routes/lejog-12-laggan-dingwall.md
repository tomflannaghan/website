We took General Wade's Military Road through Melgrave over to Fort Augustus. This is off road and as we were on road bikes, we walked around 3 km of the ascent. Most of the decent is ridable though. We would have gone along the route of the A9 if the weather was at all bad as I imagine the off road would be challenging in the wet on road bikes. The hill after Fort Augustus is a very long climb too, making this day a difficult day. Very beautiful though!

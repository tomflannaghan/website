We took General Wade's Military Road through Melgrave over to Fort Augustus. This is off road and as we were on road bikes, we walked around 3 km of the ascent. Most of the decent is ridable and it's really beautiful. SNIPPETEND Only suitable if the weather is good - if not, we would have continued on the cycle route by the A9. The hill after Fort Augustus is a very long climb too, making this day a difficult day. Stunning though!

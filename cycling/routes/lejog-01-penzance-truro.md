The first full day of cycling on the trip. We rode down to the Lizard to get the southern-most point of Great Britain into our trip. SNIPPETEND The route across the bay to St Michael's Mount was lovely, but once we reached Helston, the road down the Lizard (the A3083) wasn't very nice (although we did go on a beautiful day on the Bank Holiday weekend which probably made it worse!). They way back up north again via Goonhilly and Gweek was lovely though. We swam at Lizard, which was great fun.

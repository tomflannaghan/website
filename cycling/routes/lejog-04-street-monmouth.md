This is a very nice ride until the Avonmouth Bridge. We went up Cheddar Gorge to see it too (optional). Getting between the Avonmouth Bridge and the Severn Bridge is not particularly fun. We stuck to the Sustrans cycle routes, but these are extremely contorted. After the Severn Bridge, the route becomes nice again, with some stunning scenery coming into Monmouth from the hills.

This is my favourite relatively direct route to Lambertville and back, and is ideal if you want some time to spare in Lambertville as it's quite quick. SNIPPETEND The way out is hillier and more scenic. Some of the route is repeated on the way back but these roads feel very different in each direction so it's not too boring.

This is a nice ride south of Cambridge, with some hills in the middle, ideal for an after work ride in the summer. SNIPPETEND It uses the guided busway and DNA cycle paths to get in and out of the city, and sticks to quiet roads for pretty much the whole ride. The section of the ride through Hinxton is nice but quite bitty so often I skip that bit and continue on the road through Duxford straight to Ickleton.

The process of navigating a route on Android is a bit complicated so I'll give detailed instructions. First, we need to install and set up the GPS mapping software. This part only needs to be done once.

1. Install [OsmAnd](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand). It's a great app with all the features we need.

2. Launch OsmAnd, and go to `Settings->Navigation->Voice Guidance` and select your language.

3. In `Settings->Data Management` download the maps for the area you are interested in (e.g. your country or state).

Next, we need to get the route into the phone. This is best done when the phone is connected to a PC rather than directly on the phone.

1. [Download the GPX file]({{page.gpx}}) for this route.

2. Copy the GPX file to `osmand/tracks` on the phone's sd card. You may need to make the `tracks` directory yourself.

3. Launch OsmAnd and go to the map.

4. Click the menu button (three lines on top of each other).

5. Click `Configure Map` and then `GPX track...`. Select the track from the list. It should now display on the map.

6. Finally, click the menu button again, and click `Directions`. Answer yes to the dialog that pops up, and then to actually start the navigation, press the blue triangle symbol in the bottom right corner.

All done. Enjoy your ride :-)

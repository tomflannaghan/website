  description: In June 2021 I completed this ride with a couple of friends. We stayed in hotels and B&Bs along the route. The route is slightly longer than the most direct route (it's a total of 1636 km, or 1016 miles), but very scenic, with almost all of the route on country lanes and cycle paths.

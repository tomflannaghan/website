[RRTM](http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html) is a radiation code that is widely used in atmospheric science. The code has a rather nasty ascii interface that is a big obstacle to using the code in scripts. It is also a big barrier to reasonable performance if lots of radiative transfer calculations need doing. pyrrtm aims to address these issues, allowing RRTM to work well alongside python.

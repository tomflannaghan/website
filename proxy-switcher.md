This is an [extension to Gnome Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/771/proxy-switcher/) ([git repo here](https://github.com/tomflannaghan/proxy-switcher)) that makes switching between Gnome's proxy profiles simpler. Gnome's proxy profiles ("Automatic", "Manual" and "None") determine the system-wide proxy settings used by (among other things) Google Chrome.

The extension is *translated into lots of different languages*. I was able to do this because the phrases used in the extension also appear in the Network Settings program [<code>gnome-control-center</code>](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-control-center/), and have therefore been translated already by others.

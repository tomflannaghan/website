I am a research assistant working with Professor Stephan Fueglistaler
at the
[Atmosphere Ocean Sciences Program](http://www.princeton.edu/aos/) at
Princeton University. I study [equatorial waves]({{/research.html}})
and related phenomena near the tropopause and in the stratosphere.

I do a lot of [programming]({{/postlist_full.html')}}) both at work and
for fun in my spare time. Most of the time I code in python but I also
enjoy working with other languages (in particular,
[functional languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).)

I also love cycling, and at the moment ride with the
[Princeton Freewheelers](http://princetonfreewheelers.com/).

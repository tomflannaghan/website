I am a Python programmer working in the finance industry. Before September 2014, I was a research assistant working with Professor Stephan Fueglistaler at the [Atmosphere Ocean Sciences Program](http://www.princeton.edu/aos/) at Princeton University, where I [researched](/pubs.html) the tropical climate, tropical tropopause and related phenomena such as equatorial waves and the QBO.

In my spare time, I enjoy [cycling](/cycling) and  [programming](/postlist_full.html). A few of the programming things that I have done are available on the [projects](/projects.html) page. 
I have also compiled some of my [favourite bike rides](/cycling) here.

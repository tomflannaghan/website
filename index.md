I am a research assistant working with Professor Stephan Fueglistaler at the [Atmosphere Ocean Sciences Program](http://www.princeton.edu/aos/) at Princeton University studying [equatorial waves](/research.html) and related phenomena near the tropopause and in the stratosphere. I also do a lot of [programming](/postlist_full.html) both at work and for fun in my spare time. A few things that I have done are available on the [projects](/projects.html) page.

I also love [cycling](/cycling) and have compiled some of my [favourite rides](/cycling) here.

<p>I have written up and released some of the things I have
coded. I'll add more to this page when I have time.</p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">Proxy Switcher</h3>
    <p>This is an <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/771/proxy-switcher/">extension to Gnome Shell</a> (<a href="https://github.com/tomflannaghan/proxy-switcher">git repo here</a>) that makes switching between Gnome's proxy profiles simpler. Gnome's proxy profiles ("Automatic", "Manual" and "None") determine the system-wide proxy settings used by (among other things) Google Chrome.</p>
    <p>The extension is <b>translated into lots of different languages</b>. I was able to do this because the phrases used in the extension also appear in the Network Settings program (<a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-control-center/"><code>gnome-control-center</code></a>), and have therefore been translated already by others.</p>

I have written up and released some of the things I have
coded. I'll add more to this page when I have time.

- [Proxy Switcher](/proxy-switcher.html) --- a Gnome shell extension for switching proxy settings very conviniently.
- [pyrrtm](/pyrrtm.html) --- a python module for interfacing with the RRTM radiation code.

I've also contributed to some open source projects including [scipy](http://www.scipy.org) (I did some work on the ``scipy.stats`` module) and [matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org), where I wrote the script that eventually turned into the ``matplotlib.streamplot`` module (as illustrated in the banner to the site!).
